Summary:        Daemon and CLI for controlling Elgato Key Lights

# gaffer's own code is GPL-3.0-or-later. Rust binaries statically link their
# whole dependency tree, so this is the *effective* licence of the shipped
# artefacts, with every "OR" in the tree already resolved to one choice:
#
#   GPL-3.0-or-later  gaffer itself
#   MIT               chosen for every dual/tri-licensed crate
#   Apache-2.0        unavoidable: sync_wrapper is Apache-2.0 only
#   Unicode-3.0       unavoidable: the ICU data crates
#
# Nothing here needs BSD-3-Clause, LLVM-exception or LGPL: each appears only as
# one branch of an OR whose MIT branch was taken instead.
#
# VERIFY after any dependency change against the LICENSE SUMMARY block that
# %%{cargo_license_summary} prints into the build log. Fedora treats a wrong
# License field as a review blocker.

%description
gaffer discovers Elgato Key Lights on the local network over mDNS and owns
their state, exposing them on the D-Bus session bus so that any desktop client
— a panel module, a hotkey, a GTK or Qt application — controls the same lights
without re-implementing the protocol.

The package installs two programs: gafferd, the daemon, which is started on
demand through D-Bus activation; and gaffer, a command-line client suitable for
binding to compositor hotkeys or driving a status-bar module.

%build
# Bake the exact NVR into the daemon, readable at runtime as
# Manager1.BuildId and `gafferd --version`. The vendored tarball has no git
# metadata, so without this a packaged build could only report the crate
# version — which is identical across every snapshot between two releases, and
# so cannot answer "is the running daemon the one I just installed?". That
# matters because RPM scriptlets run as root and cannot restart a *user*
# service: an upgrade replaces the binary while the old process keeps running.

%changelog
* Sat Aug 08 2026 Jose Tiburcio Ribeiro Netto <jnetto@mineiro.io> - 0.2.0-2
- Rebuild. The packaging now verifies Source0 against a recorded sha256 on
  every build, so this is the first artefact whose source was checked rather
  than assumed. gaffer itself is unchanged.
- This release exists because 0.2.0-1 was built twice from different trees.
  Both builds package the same software, but two artefacts sharing one NVR is
  exactly what dnf cannot distinguish, so the number moves rather than being
  quietly reused.

* Sat Aug 08 2026 Jose Tiburcio Ribeiro Netto <jnetto@mineiro.io> - 0.2.0-1
- Gangs: link lights so they move as one instrument, keeping the brightness
  difference they had. Offset and mirror modes; the first lamp named leads.
- Scenes: save and restore the whole desk, storing gangs and their spacing
  rather than a flat list of brightnesses.
- Manager1 gains Link, Unlink, SetLinkMode, SetLinkLevel, LinkLevel,
  SaveScene, ApplyScene, DeleteScene, and the Links, Scenes and BuildId
  properties. All additive; nothing existing changed shape.
- BuildId and `gaffer version` report which build is actually running, and
  the CLI warns when the daemon was upgraded but never restarted.
- Require mdns-sd 0.20.3, which fixes a panic in the mDNS packet write path
  reachable from a hostile advertisement on the local network.

* Sat Jul 25 2026 Jose Tiburcio Ribeiro Netto <jnetto@mineiro.dev> - 0.1.0-1
- Initial package
